Here's an updated version of the README, tailored for your project:

# Login URL Shortener Frontend

This is the frontend of a URL shortener application with user authentication, built using React. The application allows users to create an account, log in, and manage their shortened URLs.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to manage their shortened URLs.
- **URL Shortening**: Input a long URL and receive a shortened version.
- **Link Redirection**: Clicking on a shortened link redirects to the original URL.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI for both mobile and desktop.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid input or login failures.

## Demo

[Demo Link](https://login-url-shortener-fe.vercel.app/) (Include this if you have a live version hosted)

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling routing and navigation within the app.
- **Axios**: For making API calls to the backend.
- **Bootstrap/Custom CSS**: For responsive and consistent styling.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hduraimurugan/Login_URL_Shortener_FE.git
    cd Login_URL_Shortener_FE
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The app will be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Backend

This project requires the backend URL shortener API with authentication functionality to work properly. Make sure the backend is running and that the base URL is configured correctly in the Axios requests.

```js
// Example API base URL configuration in api.js or wherever Axios is used
axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:5000/api",  // Replace with your backend URL
});
```
